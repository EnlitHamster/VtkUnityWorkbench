# VtkToUnity Binary Plugin Build

This is a build of the plugin developed by the 3D Heart project (http://www.3dheart.co.uk/) to enable VTK (https://vtk.org/) OpenGL rendering within a Unity (https://unity.com/) application. It is especially targets volume rendering or medical images, for example Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

The plugin has been build for Windows 64bit development using Visual Studio 2017.
