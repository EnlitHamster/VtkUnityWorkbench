These are example scenes and associated assets to demonstrate the plugin developed by the 3D Heart project (http://www.3dheart.co.uk/) to enable VTK (https://vtk.org/) OpenGL rendering within a Unity (https://unity.com/) application. It is especially targets volume rendering or medical images, for example Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).

The plugin has been build for Windows 64bit development using Visual Studio 2017.

For an example of this plugin in use please see https://gitlab.com/3dheart_public/vtktounity
